## Project Setup

This project assumes you have [Node.js v8](http://nodejs.org/) or greater installed which comes
the latest [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) v5 or greater installed as well. 

> Note: Sean uses [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/) instead of npm at times in this course. yarn and npm do the same thing, with a slightly different API.
> `npm run dev` vs `yarn dev`
> `npm install webpack-dev-server --save-dev` vs `yarn install webpack-dev-server --save`

There are different branches depending on which course you are going through.

3. [Clone](https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/) your fork
